# Project Assessment
## For classifying product names to categories:
- What precision (P@1) were you able to achieve?
    * 0.964

- What fastText parameters did you use?
    * epochs=25, lr=1.0, wordNgrams=2

- How did you transform the product names?
    * Remove all non-alphanumeric characters other than underscore.
    * Convert all letters to lowercase.
    * Trim excess space characters so that tokens are separated by a single space.

- How did you prune infrequent category labels, and how did that affect your precision?
    * Removed all labels with count less than 500. Precision went up from 0.65 to 0.964

## For deriving synonyms from content:

- What were the results for your best model in the tokens used for evaluation?

- What fastText parameters did you use?
    * epoch=25 and minCount=20

- How did you transform the product names?
    ```
    cat /workspace/datasets/fasttext/titles.txt | sed -e "s/\([.\!?,'/()]\)/ \1 /g" | tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]" | sed "s/[^[:alnum:]]/ /g" | tr -s ' ' > /workspace/datasets/fasttext/normalized_titles.txt
    ```

## For integrating synonyms with search:

- How did you transform the product names (if different than previously)?
    * Used default transformations

- What threshold score did you use?
    * 0.75

- Were you able to find the additional results by matching synonyms?
    Yes. It was interesting to see more relevant results for the query `nespresso`
